# **RelativityLab – Ultra-Fast AI-Generated STEM Interaction Lab**

RelativityLab is a collection of **modern, high-fidelity, interactive STEM simulations** across **physics, mathematics, and chemistry** — all **conceived, designed, and fully implemented in only 4 hours using Google’s Gemini 3**.  

This project demonstrates how **AI-assisted rapid prototyping** can produce visually polished, pedagogically meaningful scientific simulations that normally take days or weeks to build.

## 🚀 About the Build Process  
This entire project — **UI design**, **interaction logic**, **mathematical models**, **physics simulations**, **Three.js scenes**, and all **polish/animation** — was generated in **four hours using Gemini 3**, followed by lightweight adjustments.

The goal was to test the limits of:

- AI-assisted rapid visual prototyping  
- AI-generated scientific simulations  
- High-quality code synthesis within extreme time constraints  

The successful result is RelativityLab: **a fully functional, aesthetically cohesive, multi-domain STEM visualization lab**.
